C++ Conditionals, Ternary Operators, and Loops
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains C++ examples covering conditional statements (if, else, switch), ternary operators (? :), and loops (for, while, do-while). These are fundamental concepts in C++ programming, allowing efficient control flow and decision-making.

ðŸ“‚ Contents
ðŸŸ¢ 1. Conditionals (if, else, switch)
if_else_example.cpp â†’ Demonstrates the usage of if, else if, and else.
switch_case_example.cpp â†’ Example using switch for multiple conditions.
ðŸ”µ 2. Ternary Operator (? :)
ternary_operator.cpp â†’ Shows how to replace simple if-else statements with a ternary operator.
ðŸŸ  3. Loops (for, while, do-while)
for_loop_example.cpp â†’ Example of a counting loop using for.
while_loop_example.cpp â†’ Demonstrates an iterative loop using while.
do_while_example.cpp â†’ Explains do-while execution flow.

ðŸ“– Topics Covered
âœ… Conditionals (if-else)
Used to make decisions in a program.
if-else is useful for binary or multiple conditions.
switch is optimal for handling multiple discrete values efficiently.

âœ… Ternary Operator (? :)
A compact way to write simple conditional expressions.

âœ… Loops (for, while, do-while)
for: Used when the number of iterations is known.
while: Runs as long as the condition is true.
do-while: Ensures the loop runs at least once.
